    I hereby declare that, with the approval of my examiner, I have
employed the generative AI tools X, Y, and Z through
University services during the preparation of this thesis solely for
spellchecking and enhancing the formality of my written
expression. Furthermore, I expressly confirm that this tool was not
used to generate data or as a source of factual information or content
for this thesis.
